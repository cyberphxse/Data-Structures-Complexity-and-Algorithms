## Matrices in Python 3
### What is a Matrix?
In the realm of math, a matrix is an illustration of numbers, symbols or expressions within a 2d array 

In the realm of computer science, specifically in python, we are able to begin to make a data strcuture that has values within rows as well as columns, similar to a table, by using a list inside of a list. 

There are extrinsic libraries/modules that are able to be imported into your python program to aid in this procedure; although, for now, we will be making them in the standalone python version 

This is a basic notion in the realm of math, specifically in the calculus/vectors as well as linear algebra
